# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Uninformative Error Message

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process fails without providing a clear error message, making debugging difficult.

## Problem

When attempting to build an Android APK using `expo build:android`, the build process fails, often with a generic error message. The output doesn't pinpoint the exact cause of the failure, making it challenging to identify and resolve the problem.

## Solution

The solution depends on the underlying cause. The provided example shows how to fix some of the common causes. The solution might involve:

* Checking the Android SDK installation and environment variables.

* Ensuring that the necessary Android build tools are installed and configured correctly.
* Correcting any misconfigurations in the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
* Cleaning the project using `expo prebuild` and retrying the build.
* Running `expo doctor` to ensure a healthy Expo setup.
* Updating Expo CLI and related dependencies to the latest versions.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Attempt to build the Android APK using `expo build:android`.
4. Observe the uninformative error message.
5. Implement the solution provided in `buildSolution.js`.
6. Retry building the APK.

## Additional Notes

This repository serves as an example of the problem and its resolution. It's crucial to examine the complete error log, debug logs, and possibly the build logs for a more comprehensive diagnosis.
