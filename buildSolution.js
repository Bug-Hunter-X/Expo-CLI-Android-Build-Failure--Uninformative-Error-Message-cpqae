The solution involves systematically checking different aspects of the Android build process. This might involve:

1. **Cleaning the project:** Run `expo prebuild` to clean the build cache and temporary files.
2. **Checking the Android SDK:** Ensure that the Android SDK is correctly installed and the necessary components are downloaded.
3. **Inspecting `build.gradle`:** Look for any syntax errors, missing dependencies, or incorrect configurations in the `android/app/build.gradle` file. Make sure your dependencies are up-to-date.
4. **Verifying Dependencies:** Review your `package.json` to ensure that all dependencies are compatible and correctly installed. Resolve any issues related to dependency conflicts.
5. **Checking Environment Variables:** Verify that the necessary environment variables (ANDROID_HOME, JAVA_HOME, etc.) are set correctly for your system.
6. **Running `expo doctor`:** This command checks your Expo setup for any issues that might be affecting the build process.  
7. **Updating Expo:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of Expo CLI by running `npm update expo-cli` or `yarn upgrade expo-cli`.
8. **Restarting the process:** Sometimes, a simple restart of the build process can resolve temporary issues.

By following these steps and carefully examining the logs, you can generally identify the specific problem leading to the uninformative Android build failure in Expo CLI.
